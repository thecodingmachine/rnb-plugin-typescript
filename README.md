# TheCodingMachine React Native boilerplate - Typescript Plugin

This project is a part of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides **an optimized architecture for building solid cross-platform mobile applications** through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic. It is fully documented so that each piece of code that lands in your application can be understood and used.

## Quick start

To create a new project using the boilerplate simply run :

```
npx react-native init MyApp --template @thecodingmachine/react-native-boilerplate
```

And selected `typescript` as language when it will be asked.

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can run the project by running:

- `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `yarn <platform>` to run the *platform* application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device)
